# Projects from "Big book of small Pyton projects" 

This repository contains all 81 projects from "Big book of small Python pojects"
wirtten by Al Sweigart. All projects will contain 3 files:
1. First file will contain code straight from book
2. Second file is going to be README with instructions
3. Last one is going to be my attempt to write project all by myself

I will stick to the instructions provided in book. Firstly I will rewrite project from book and than try to do it myself. I'm doing it mainly to train my Git skills and practice some Python.

Enjoy! :smile:
